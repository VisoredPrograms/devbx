# devbx

devbx (short for dev-blox) is a lightweight version-control system for Roblox places, inspired by Git but focused on syncing Roblox place files. Built on Lune, a fast Luau runtime in Rust, it lets you fetch updates from the Roblox API, commit local changes, and checkout (open) the game. Designed specifically for Roblox, devbx simplifies managing place files and launching games with fast, clear operations.
